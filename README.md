Objectives
- Complete the network documentation.
- Perform basic device configurations on a router and a switch.
- Verify connectivity and troubleshoot any issues.

Scenario
Your network manager is impressed with your performance in your job as a LAN technician. She would like you to demonstrate your ability to configure a router that connects two LANs. Your tasks include configuring basic settings on a router and a switch using the Cisco IOS. You will also configure IPv6 addresses on network devices and hosts. You will verify the configurations by testing end-to-end connectivity. Your goal is to establish connectivity between all devices.

Note: The VLAN1 interfaces on the switches will not be reachable over IPv6.
In this activity, you will configure the College router, Class-B switch, and the PC hosts.
Note: Packet Tracer will not score some configured values, however these values are required to accomplish full connectivity in the network.
Konfigurasi Router

Requirements
- Provide the missing information in the Addressing Table.
  Note: Some of the information is provided in the Packet Tracer instructions for your topology.
- Name the router College and the second switch Class-B. You will not be able to access the Class-A switch.
- Use cisco as the user EXEC password for all lines.
- Use class as the encrypted privileged EXEC password.
- Encrypt all plaintext passwords.
- Configure an appropriate banner.
- Configure IPv4 and IPv6 addressing for the College router according to the Addressing Table.
- Configure IPv4 addressing for the Class-B switch according to the Addressing Table.
- Configure the default gateway for Class-B switch.
- Document interfaces with descriptions, including the Class-B VLAN 1 interface.
- Save your configurations.
- The hosts are partially configured. Complete the IPv4 addressing, and fully configure the IPv6 addresses according to the Addressing Table.
- Verify connectivity between all devices. All devices should be able to ping all other devices with IPv4 and IPv6.
- Troubleshoot and document any issues.
- Implement the solutions necessary to enable and verify full end-to-end connectivity.
